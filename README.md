# README: Optimizing US-Global Health Commodity Shipment Plan

## Description
This project implements a data analysis pipeline to explore transportation patterns using NYC Yellow Taxi and Uber data,. Key functionalities include programmatic data downloading, sampling, and preprocessing, along with creating a SQLite database for data storage and querying. The analysis focuses on identifying trends in ride-sharing demand, travel distances, and other metrics. The project integrates interactive visualizations, animations, and Jupyter widgets to provide dynamic insights into transportation data.
