# Final-Project-jwl2183

# README: Optimizing US-Global Health Commodity Shipment Plan

## Description
This follows Professor Lynn's instructions: 

Part 1: Data processing for Uber & taxi data (no weather data);
Part 2: Data storage for uber & taxi data (no weather-related tables or anything)
Part 3: Queries 1-3
Part 4: Visualizations 1-3

This project implements a data analysis pipeline to explore transportation patterns using NYC Yellow Taxi and Uber data,. Key functionalities include programmatic data downloading, sampling, and preprocessing, along with creating a SQLite database for data storage and querying. The project integrates interactive visualizations, animations, and Jupyter widgets to provide dynamic insights into transportation data.

## Group Name
Project Group 19

## Team Member (Completed solo)
- UNI ID[jwl2183]

## Key Features
- **Data Download and Management**: Automates the download of NYC taxi, Uber trip data.
- **Preprocessing**: Performs data cleaning, filtering, and sampling for efficient analysis.
- **Database Integration**: Creates and manages a SQLite database to query datasets efficiently.
- **Exploratory Queries**: Executes SQL queries to analyze popular travel hours, distance.
- **Visualizations**: Produces three required required queries and visualizations, including an animated bar chart and interactive widgets, to explore query results dynamically.

## Extra Credit
2.5% for adding one or more animations
